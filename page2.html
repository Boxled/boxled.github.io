  <body style="background-color:green;">
    <p>this website is just something for me to test HTML code in, and <br>
      it's <i><big> very </big></i> terrible lol, so i thought i'd make it public because <br>
      it's funny <br><br>

      i'm soon gonna implement comments into this little website, so people can <br>
      post comments ("username says: stuff") without me having to add it myself. aight bye

      <br> another idea: when you click obama's nose, it makes a clown nose sound</p>


      <p>i would've never been able to make a website without this website!!!
      <br> please go check it out!!!!</p>
